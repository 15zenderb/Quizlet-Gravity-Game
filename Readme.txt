Hey Friends,

I made this code because I found the gravity game on Quizlet extremely helpful for learning some great information.
Unfortunately, they you can no longer access it on the website, so I've coded a new game for the world. 

You can modify the questions and answers by uploading your own "Questions.csv" file and pasting it into the main directory. 

That's pretty much it, have fun and keep learning!
