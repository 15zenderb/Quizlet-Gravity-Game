Hey Friends,

I made this code because I found the gravity game on Quizlet extremely helpful for learning some great information.
Unfortunately, they removed it and you can no longer access it on the website, so I've coded a new game for the world. 

You can modify the questions and answers by uploading your own "Questions.csv" (name doesn't matter) file using the settings menu. 

That's pretty much it, have fun and keep learning!

If you want to end the game, go to pause then press "="
